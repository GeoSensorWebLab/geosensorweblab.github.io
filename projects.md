    <p>
        The BERA Project is a collaboration project to develop and build field research processes for collecting biodiversity data in Alberta's boreal forests. The GeoSensorWeb Lab is building remote sensing devices that can collect real-time data and publish to a public and standards-based platform, where users can view data on the web.
