## OGC CDB: Advancing Interoperability for Dynamic Environmental Representations (2016 – Present)

<div class="flex">
<div>
    <p>
        The OGC CDB Project is a collaboration project with CAE Inc. to advance interoperability for dynamic environmental representations. Effective training and simulation requires producing a unified synthetic representation of the world. Each simulation generates a synthetic environment using various types of geospatial information and processes with redundancies and data inconsistencies. Applications of such dynamic Modeling and Simulation (M&S) include aviation, emergency response, defense and military, etc. To enhance realism and efficiency in dynamic M&S applications, one of the most pressing needs is a “plug-and-play” synthetic environment database that can be shared, reused, and repurposed. However the current situation is that M&S simulators require their own proprietary synthetic environment databases. The objective of this project is to develop an interoperable and high performance open geospatial standard specification for dynamic synthetic environmental representations.

    <p>
        The BERA Project is a collaboration project to develop and build field research processes for collecting biodiversity data in Alberta's boreal forests. The GeoSensorWeb Lab is building remote sensing devices that can collect real-time data and publish to a public and standards-based platform, where users can view data on the web.

## <a href="http://arcticconnect.org">ArcticConnect</a> (2014 – Present)

<p>
    ArcticConnect is a CANARIE Network-Enabled Platform (NEP) project with the Arctic Institute of North America and Cybera, Inc. It is a set of tools and applications for improving geospatial visualization of data and research related to the arctic. The GeoSensorWeb Lab assisted in building multiple parts of the project.

        <h4><a href="https://webmap.arcticconnect.org/">ArcticWebMap</a></h4>
        <p>
            ArcticWebMap is a free tile server for OpenStreetMap data re-projected into multiple arctic-focused projections. This improves the display of shapes closer to the north pole. The tile server is actively maintained by the GeoSensorWeb Lab.

## <a href="https://www.canarie.ca/canarie-announces-next-phase-of-software-development-program-supporting-cutting-edge-canadian-research/">CANARIE RPI</a> (2013 – 2014)

The CANARIE RPI was a project to expand previous NEP work with an open API for integration with future NEP projects as well as public access. The GeoSensorWeb Lab built an open HTTP database for accessing sensor metadata and sensor data, as well as a web front-end for visualizing the data.

## <a href="http://eaglewatch.gswlab.ca/">EagleWatch Portal</a> (2012)

A portal to view historical sightings data for migratory eagle species in the Canadian Rockies.

## <a href="http://rockyview.gswlab.ca/">Rocky View County Well Watch</a> (2011 – 2012)

A portal to view and submit ground water readings for well owners in the Rocky View County region of Alberta, Canada.

## <a href="http://geocens.gswlab.ca/">GeoCENS Project</a> (2009 – 2013)

The Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for Environmental Sensing (GeoCENS) project was a CANARIE RPI project created by the GeoSensorWeb Lab to catalog and view public OGC SOS data sources across the internet. It included a user discussion and data rating feature, to improve the rating of results. Data could be viewed online using the NASA WorldWind Java Applet. A translation engine layer was created to map SOS commands into an HTTP interface for easier consumption by web and javascript clients. A search engine crawler and database would search and catalog public SOS instances online, and provide that data to the portal with an HTTP interface.
