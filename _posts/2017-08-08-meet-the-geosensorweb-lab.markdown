The GeoSensorWeb Lab is a research group at the University of Calgary, Canada that is focused on developing web-enabled geospatial information systems and building interoperability into the Internet of Things.

We have worked with other research groups, government agencies, companies, and consortiums to bring data from private silos to the public web. By combining open standards such as HTTP/REST with previously locked-in data, we can make data accessible through live visualizations available on any platform.

For more information on our research, please see our list of publications. We also have a list of public projects, where you can interact with data live online. If you want to know more about the research lab and its members, please see the <a href="/about">about</a> page.
