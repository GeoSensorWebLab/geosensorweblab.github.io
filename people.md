  biotext="I have been a Postdoctoral fellow in the GeoSensorWeb Lab at the University of Calgary since 2015. I have been a Member of the <a href='https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/oab'>OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) Architecture Board</a> since 2020. I received my Ph.D. in 2013, from the <a href='https://mms.geomatics.ucalgary.ca/'>Multi Mobile Sensor System Research Team</a>, University of Calgary, in positioning, navigation and wireless location on smartphones. I have my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Geomatics and Civil Engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran. My interests are primarily in the field of 'sensor fusion' and 'intelligent geospatial computation' in context-aware location-based services. Sensor technologies are used almost everywhere. Connecting multi-sensor over a network increases the quality, coverage, confidence and usability of their data in real-time applications. Multi-sensor data, along with the IoT’s access to cloud-based processing resources, will lead to a tremendous expansion in the online accessibility of geospatial services anytime and everywhere."

  biotext="<p>New technologies have allowed us to conduct research at larger and larger scales, but our ability to manage such scales becomes more complex and difficult. By re-using some of the lessons learned by major technology companies like Facebook, Yahoo!, Etsy, and Bloomberg, we can take configuration management from cloud tech and apply it to sensor device tech. By managing our devices with a centralized tool, we can set up devices with less work.</p><p>Other web tech can be used to simulate and test geo-sensor networks, allowing us to design and build more robust networks that can respond to changing network and environmental conditions.</p>"

  biotext="Recent innovations in an internet of things(IoT) technology have allowed researchers to collect large and highly accurate datasets on the environment while vastly decreasing the time and cost of gathering such data. However, researchers need more stable, scalable, lower cost sensor monitoring network and more powerful monitor data processing and analysis system. By nature IoT applications are dynamic and, thus, complex and being difficult to build. Devices can be lost at any time. So does the network connection. Therefore, a new IoT architecture should be intended to meet these requirements. Based on existed technology, is possible to design an IoT architecture, which suits the environmental monitoring, using open source hardware and software. The IoT architecture contains several components. 1) Devices: It records the ecological parameters with different kinds of field sensors and actuators; 2) Gateway: It connects sensors to the world and manage the hardware and software running at the edge.3) Cloud: It is a place where process and analyze the field data; 4) User-front-end: Researchers can see the general monitoring information and data analysis result. This information will appear in a variety of charts and integrates with map."

  biotext="My interest research topic is primarily in the field of Context-Awareness and Recommender Systems. Context-Aware Systems are intelligent systems that recommend users with adaptive service choices which are appropriate to their profile preferences and contextual situations. Recently by the popularity of IoT smart devices as well as the availability of the wireless network, a massive volume of data is available to gain useful insights into user profile which contains dynamic contextual information. IoT sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data, we need to understand them and use them in a context-aware computing platform. On the other hand, Recommender Systems can be considered as an effective solution for fighting information overload. So, the integration of Context-Awareness, Recommender Systems, and other technologies including IoT, Social Networks, and Ubiquitous Computing opens new windows of opportunities to propose more efficient services."

I am experienced in Geospatial software development to facilitate mobile mapping, 2D/3D data visualization, network analysis, and spatial data management. To keep the connection with industry, I have led the software development team of the Geomatics Department of K.N.Toosi in several industrial MobileGIS projects. My research in Master was focused on how to improve the quality of Location Aware Recommender Systems using high quality Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) as well as automation of VGI quality assessment. My background in VGI and the Internet of Things(IoT) led me to study on Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) and IoT integration network models. Having added to GSWL, I broadened my technical knowledge to employ IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop real-time GIServices. 
I am always passionate to develop IoT/GIServices and leverage cutting edge technologies such as AI to solve real-world spatial problems."
