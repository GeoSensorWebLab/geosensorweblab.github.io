# GeoSensorWeb Lab Site

This is a Jekyll-based site for the GeoSensorWeb Lab at the University of Calgary. It serves as an about page, publication/project list, and blog. The site is served using GitHub Pages.

## Editing Pages

I recommend reading the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for more information on how this repository must be set up to be used with GitHub Pages.

For editing the pages in the site, create/edit `.md` or `.html` files in the root directory. The Jekyll docs [have a page on how this works](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

## Adding Blog Posts

[Jekyll Docs: Writing Posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

Posts are written in Markdown, and can have HTML embedded inside.

## Adding Images and other Static Files

Add the files to the `assets` directory. When the site is built into pages, the files will be accessible at the HTTP path `/assets`.
Any file placed in static/ should be referenced using the absolute URL /static/[filename]. If you change assetSubDirectory to assets, then these URLs will need to be changed to /assets/[filename].

## Jekyll Plugins

[GitHub Pages does not support custom plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/).

## Local Testing

If you want to test new posts/pages before publishing to GitHub, you can clone the repository to your computer and build a preview there. You will need Ruby (included with MacOS).
